# `reader` CLI — design

**Date:** 2026-07-12
**Status:** approved, ready for implementation plan

## Goal

A `reader` command on the user's PATH that drives the running (or not-yet-running) Reader.md app:
open a markdown file, add a local folder as a root, add a remote (SSH) root, list roots, remove a root,
and open piped stdin.

## Non-goals

- No terminal markdown renderer (`--print` as ANSI output). `glow`/`bat` already do that, and it shares
  nothing with the app. `reader -` pipes stdin *into the app*.
- No scripting API. The CLI is fire-and-forget and eventually consistent (see "Consistency" below).
- No new IPC machinery (XPC, sockets).

## Architecture

### Transport — the `readermd://` URL scheme

The **app remains the single writer** of `UserDefaults`. The CLI never writes prefs; it dispatches a URL
and the app performs the mutation and persists it. This dodges the clobber race that a direct-write CLI
would hit whenever the app is running and later persists its in-memory `roots`.

Custom-scheme URLs are delivered to an already-running app through `.onOpenURL` (unlike
`open --args`, whose arguments a running app never sees), and launch the app if it is not running. One
mechanism covers both states.

| Command | URL dispatched |
|---|---|
| `reader notes.md` | `readermd://open?path=/abs/notes.md` |
| `reader .` , `reader ~/docs` | `readermd://open?path=/abs/docs` |
| `reader remote me@vps:/srv/docs` | `readermd://add-remote?dest=me@vps&path=/srv/docs&name=docs` |
| `reader rm <path\|name>` | `readermd://remove?match=<token>` |
| `reader ls` | none — reads prefs directly |
| `cat x.md \| reader -` | writes a temp `.md`, then `readermd://open?path=…` |

All query values are percent-encoded by the CLI (`URLComponents`).

**One verb for files and folders.** `AppState.openDropped(_:)` already does exactly the routing the CLI
needs — directory → add as root, markdown file → open, anything else → ignore — and it already validates
the extension against `FileScanner.markdownExtensions`. The router reuses it, so:

- there is no separate `add-folder` verb, and
- `readermd://open?path=/etc/passwd` from a hostile web page is rejected, where a naive call to
  `AppState.openPath` (which does *not* check the extension) would have rendered it.

No new public `AppState` API is needed for open/add.

**Removal takes a token, not a path.** A remote root's `url` is its opaque
`~/Library/Application Support/Reader.md/remotes/<UUID>` cache directory — not something a user can
type. So `remove` carries the raw token the user typed and the **app** matches it against its in-memory
roots (absolute path first, then root/remote name), then calls `removeRoot`. Matching lives app-side
because that is where the names and the `RootFolder` values already are; the CLI stays dumb.

**App side.** `make-app.sh` adds `CFBundleURLTypes` declaring the `readermd` scheme.
`ReaderMdApp`'s existing `.onOpenURL` grows a router:

- `url.isFileURL` → today's behaviour, unchanged (Finder open).
- `readermd://` → the host is the verb: `open` → `openDropped`, `add-remote` → see below,
  `remove` → match token → `removeRoot`.
- Unknown verb, missing params, or a path that does not exist → ignored.

### Security — only `add-remote` is gated

Any web page can fire a `readermd://` link. `remove` is harmless — it deletes nothing, it only drops a
root from the list. `add-remote` is the dangerous one: it causes `rsync` over ssh with the user's
`~/.ssh` keys. `open` sits in between, and is an **accepted** cost, stated rather than waved away:

> `readermd://open?path=/` from a hostile page adds `/` as a root, which starts a recursive markdown
> scan of the whole disk plus a persistent FSEvents watcher, and *persists* it across restarts. More
> broadly, `open` isn't limited to the folder case: `readermd://open?path=` naming *any* readable `.md`
> file on disk will render it and add it to recents, same as a folder path adds a root. That is a real
> annoyance, not a data leak — no content leaves the machine, and the user can remove the root or the
> recent entry. We accept it rather than gate folder-add or file-open, because a confirmation prompt on
> every `reader .` would make the tool's primary use hostile to its primary user. Revisit if
> `readermd://` links ever appear in the wild.

So `add-remote` **arriving from a URL** opens the **prefilled Add Remote sheet** for confirmation
instead of syncing silently. The CLI's remote command therefore ends in a visible sheet the user
accepts; a drive-by URL from a web page ends in a sheet the user closes.

`SidebarView` already presents that sheet on `state.showAddRemote` (a `Bool`), which has nowhere to
carry a prefill. Add a `pendingRemote: RemoteSpec?` to `AppState`: the router sets it and flips
`showAddRemote`; the sheet seeds its fields from it when non-nil and clears it on dismiss. The sidebar's
own **Add Remote** button leaves it `nil` and behaves exactly as it does today.

### Dispatch — target the app you came from

The CLI does **not** shell out to `/usr/bin/open`, and does not rely on Launch Services choosing the
right handler. With a `build/Reader.md.app` and an `/Applications/Reader.md.app` both registered, a bare
`readermd://` URL can be routed to the stale one.

The CLI binary lives *inside* the bundle, at `Reader.md.app/Contents/MacOS/reader`. It finds its app by
**walking up from its own executable path**: `Bundle.main.executableURL`, resolved through symlinks, then
up two directories, checking the result ends in `.app`.

Two wrong ways to get that path, both of which we avoid:

- **`Bundle.main.bundleURL`.** `reader` is not the bundle's `CFBundleExecutable` (that is `Reader.md`),
  so whether `Bundle.main` climbs to the enclosing `.app` from a *secondary* executable is an
  assumption, not a guarantee — the same assumption the `ls` section refuses to make about
  `UserDefaults.standard`. `executableURL` is a different thing: dyld reporting where the running Mach-O
  actually is. That is safe; the climb is not.

- **`CommandLine.arguments[0]`.** This is the trap, and it fails on the *primary* install path.
  Homebrew's `binary` stanza puts a symlink on `PATH`, and when the user types `reader notes.md` the
  shell passes `argv[0]` as the bare word `"reader"` — not a path. `URL(fileURLWithPath: "reader")` then
  resolves it against the current working directory, yielding a path that has nothing to do with the
  binary. No bundle is found, and dispatch silently degrades to the Launch Services roulette this whole
  section exists to prevent — invisibly, on a machine with only one copy installed.
  `Bundle.main.executableURL` is dyld-backed (`_NSGetExecutablePath`), not `argv[0]`-derived, and
  survives it.

Dispatch is then `NSWorkspace.openURLs(_:withApplicationAt:configuration:completionHandler:)` against
that bundle: the app you invoked is the app that answers, no Launch Services roulette, and the scheme
need not even be registered for this path to work.

**That API is asynchronous.** A CLI that returns from `main` right after calling it exits before the
launch dispatches, and the command silently does nothing. The process must block on a `DispatchSemaphore`
until the completion handler fires (with a timeout), and exit non-zero if it reports an error.

If the executable is not inside an `.app` (dev builds run out of `.build/`), it falls back to the
synchronous `NSWorkspace.open(url) -> Bool`, which needs the scheme registered — meaning a packaged
build must have been launched at least once. If that also fails, it reports that Reader.md could not be
found and exits 1.

### The CLI binary

A second SwiftPM executable target (product `reader`), a single Swift file, no dependencies. Built by
`swift build`; `make-app.sh` copies it to `Contents/MacOS/reader` alongside the app executable.

The entry point is `@main` in `ReaderCLI.swift` — *not* top-level code in `main.swift`, which SwiftPM
cannot `@testable import` from a test target. This is what makes the pure logic below testable.

- **Path resolution** — relative paths are made absolute against the cwd, `~` expanded, and the result
  standardized with `NSString.standardizingPath` (collapsing `.`/`..`/trailing slashes, and stripping a
  leading `/private` from an existing path — so `reader /tmp/notes` and `reader /private/tmp/notes` both
  land on `/tmp/notes`, one root). Symlinks generally are **not** resolved: a path through a user symlink
  reaches the app as typed. The result is sent as `open`, and the
  app decides file-vs-folder. The CLI still validates locally first so the user gets feedback instead of
  silence: a path that does not exist, or a file whose extension is not markdown, is a message on stderr
  and exit 1. (The app re-checks anyway — it must, since URLs also arrive from elsewhere.)
- **`ls`** — reads `reader.md.folders` (string array) and `reader.md.remotes` (JSON blob) from the
  `com.nahian.reader-md` domain. Remotes are decoded with `JSONSerialization` into dictionaries, so the
  `RemoteSpec` struct is not duplicated in the CLI. Prints one root per line; remote roots are tagged
  with their `user@host:/path`.

  **The domain must be named explicitly** — `CFPreferencesCopyAppValue(key, "com.nahian.reader-md")`,
  not `UserDefaults.standard`. Inside the packaged `.app`, `Bundle.main` resolves to the app and
  `.standard` would happen to be right; run from `.build/debug/reader` there is no enclosing bundle and
  `.standard` silently reads a *different, empty* domain. Naming the domain is correct in both.

  **And it must synchronize first** — `CFPreferencesAppSynchronize("com.nahian.reader-md")` before the
  read. `cfprefsd` hands each process a cached snapshot; without this a freshly spawned `reader ls` can
  miss a value the app wrote moments ago.

- **`rm <token>`** — passes the token through to the app, which does the matching (see above). The CLI
  does not resolve it, so it needs no knowledge of how remote roots are named or where they cache.
- **stdin (`-`)** — reads stdin, writes it to
  `~/Library/Caches/com.nahian.reader-md/stdin/<epoch>.md`, opens that path. The `.md` extension is
  required or the app will not render it as markdown. The CLI cannot delete the file before the app has
  read it, so ownership of cleanup sits with the CLI: on each run it reaps stdin temps older than one
  day.

  These temps must be **kept out of recents**. `AppState.open()` pushes every non-bundled path there, so
  without an exclusion `reader -` litters the recent-files list with paths that get reaped a day later,
  leaving dead entries. `isBundledDoc` already establishes the pattern for a path-prefix exclusion; the
  stdin cache directory gets the same treatment.
- **`reader` with no args** — usage on stdout, exit 0.

### Consistency

`reader ~/docs` dispatches a URL and returns immediately; the app handles it and persists asynchronously.
`reader ~/docs && reader ls` may therefore not list it yet. This is acceptable for an interactive tool
and is documented; no read-after-write guarantee is offered.

## Install

- **Homebrew** — the cask gains
  `binary "#{appdir}/Reader.md.app/Contents/MacOS/reader"`. Brew symlinks it into its prefix
  (`/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple silicon) on install, and removes it on uninstall. Nothing else to do.

- **DMG users** — a **File → Install `reader` Command Line Tool** menu item. It attempts a plain symlink
  into `/usr/local/bin/reader` and, when that fails, shows an alert with the exact `sudo ln -s …` command
  and a **Copy** button.

  The failure path is the *normal* one, not an edge case: `/usr/local/bin` is `root:wheel` `drwxr-xr-x` on
  a stock macOS install, so an unprivileged symlink there fails with `EACCES`. The direct attempt only
  succeeds on machines where the user already owns the directory (typically Intel-Homebrew boxes). The app
  does **not** escalate — no `osascript … with administrator privileges`, no privileged helper, no
  `SMJobBless`. Handing the user one line to paste is a smaller and more honest thing than an app that
  asks for root to make a symlink.

  If `/usr/local/bin/reader` already exists (e.g. a previous install), the alert says so rather than
  clobbering it.

**Quarantine caveat.** A DMG dragged to `/Applications` carries `com.apple.quarantine`, and the app is
only ad-hoc signed. The first launch of the *app* (right-click → Open) clears it for the bundle, which
covers the nested `reader` binary too. Homebrew strips quarantine on cask install, so brew users never
see this. The README's CLI section says to launch the app once before using the CLI.

## Verification

- **`swift test`** covers the CLI's pure logic, which is where the bugs are: argument → URL mapping,
  path resolution (relative, `~`, trailing slash, missing file), percent-encoding of paths with spaces
  and `&`, and parsing of `user@host:/path` (including malformed input).
  (`@testable import` of an executable target is already how every existing test in `ReaderMdTests`
  works, so this carries no toolchain risk.)

- **By hand** — the parts no unit test reaches:
  1. Build the `.app`, add a folder through the GUI, then run
     `/Applications/Reader.md.app/Contents/MacOS/reader ls`. It must list that folder. *This is the check
     that catches the prefs-domain and `cfprefsd`-cache bugs; a test run under `swift run` would not.*
  2. `reader ~/some/dir` with the app running, and again with it closed.
  3. With both a `build/Reader.md.app` and an installed copy present, confirm the CLI's URL lands in the
     app it was invoked from — not the other one.
  4. `codesign -vvv --deep --strict` on the bundle after `make-app.sh`: `reader` is a second Mach-O in
     `Contents/MacOS`, i.e. nested code that must be sealed, not treated as a resource.
  5. `echo '# hi' | reader -` renders, the temp file lands in the cache dir with a `.md` extension, and
     it does **not** appear in recents.
  6. `reader ~/docs; echo $?` — the CLI must not exit before the async dispatch completes (the failure
     mode is a silent no-op with exit 0), and must exit non-zero when the app cannot be launched.
